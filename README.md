GitHub already sends notifications through emails if you’ve opted in, but many studies have shown that push notifications reach users better than emails do. After you’ve built the GitHub tracker by following this tutorial, you’ll have learned how to:

-   add a service worker and convert the tracker to a PWA
-   subscribe to push notifications
-   use the GitHub API
-   send push events through Vercel cloud functions
-   periodically fetch new issues using EasyCron
